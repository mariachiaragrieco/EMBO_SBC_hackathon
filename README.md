Codes for EMBO Hackathon "The Spatial Biology of Cancer"

Participants will cluster according to the background to have groups of homogeneous compositions during lunch break.
Every level will be provided with few chunks of codes, some functionals and some not, to help participants in solving tasks.
Levels will compare different spatial sequecing data from ovarian carcinomas.
If a group will complete the level before the end of the section we will double-check the results and, if ok, register the timing.
The group that solved all the levels in the smallest amount of time win the game.
